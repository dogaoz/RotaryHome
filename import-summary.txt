ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Risky Project Location:
-----------------------
The tools *should* handle project locations in any directory. However,
due to bugs, placing projects in directories containing spaces in the
path, or characters like ", ' and &, have had issues. We're working to
eliminate these bugs, but to save yourself headaches you may want to
move your project to a location where this is not a problem.
/Volumes/DATA/Android Development/RotaryHome
                     -                      

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => socialauthandroid32/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => socialauthandroid32/src/main/assets
* libs/socialauth-4.3.jar => socialauthandroid32/libs/socialauth-4.3.jar
* lint.xml => socialauthandroid32/lint.xml
* res/ => socialauthandroid32/src/main/res/
* src/ => socialauthandroid32/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
